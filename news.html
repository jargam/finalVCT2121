          The state of Minnesota says it is “sunsetting” its longstanding
          mail-order COVID-19 lab test program through Vault Health this week, and
          will start offering at-home rapid tests through the mail starting
          Tuesday. <br /><br />“Even as case numbers decline, it’s important that
          Minnesotans test for COVID-19 if they are feeling sick,” Gov. Tim Walz
          said in a statement about the program. “That’s why we’re continuing to
          work to make tests easily accessible — now and in the future.” He said
          the state has secured 500,000 rapid antigen test kits, with two tests in
          each kit. <br /><br />Starting Tuesday, Minnesotans can order two kits, for a
          total of four tests per household, through an online ordering system at
          mn.gov/covid19. The program will send them out until they are gone.
          <br /><br />The state is offering the antigen tests as it says demand for the
          free Vault PCR tests, which had to be mailed back to a lab, has dropped
          from more than 16,600 a week in January, to about 1,400 last week. The
          state said the antigen tests “provide more flexibility to Minnesota
          families who need to monitor COVID-19 symptoms. <br /><br />The tests can be done at
          home and results are delivered within minutes, with no lab delivery
          required.” <br />People who still have Vault PCR tests can use them up
          until their expiration date, or through the end of 2022, whichever is
          first.<br /><br />

          Police in St. Paul say a 59-year-old man suffered life-threatening
          injuries in a hit-and-run incident Thursday evening. Police were
          dispatched at around 10:30 p.m. to the intersection of Sixth Street and
          Cedar Avenue on the report of a hit-and-run incident. When they arrived,
          they found the victim unresponsive and with “significant injuries.”
          <br /><br />
          The victim was taken to Regions Hospital where he is listed in critical
          condition with life-threatening injuries. Police reviewed surveillance
          footage and observed a silver BMW strike the man and leave the scene. A
          witness told police that the man was crossing the street when he was
          struck. <br /><br />
          According to police, a 37-year-old man arrived at the scene shortly
          after the incident and said his mechanic was driving the vehicle. He
          said the mechanic told him he hit someone and fled the scene. “The man
          gave officers information about the suspect and said he wasn’t in the
          car at the time of the accident,” police said. <br /><br />
          Police located the BMW and impounded it. <br /><br />The investigation is
          active. No arrests have yet been made.<br /><br />

          Runners were gearing up for the Boston Marathon on Monday, marking the
          return of the prestigious race to its springtime spot for the first time
          since the pandemic began.<br /><br />
          At 6 a.m. in Hopkinton, Race Director Dave McGillivray sent out a group
          of about 20 from the Massachusetts National Guard, which walks the
          course annually, announcing the start of the 126th Boston Marathon. He
          told them that the "comeback is greater than the setback." McGillivray
          said in an interview that "it's a new normal," with some pandemic
          protocols still in place — like requiring participants to be vaccinated
          or show an exemption — "but it's a normal." He said he's using the
          catchphrase because "we're about to see that come to life." "We
          recognize that we're not totally out of the woods. We're still sensitive
          to the virus and requiring vaccinations," he said. "We're really not
          back to normal for the time being, but this is what the new normal is.
          The key is keeping everyone safe."<br /><br />
          The wheelchair divisions were to start shortly after 9 a.m., followed by
          the elite fields. Eleven former champions are competing. McGillivray
          said it's "one of the greatest assembled pro fields of all time." It has
          been only six months since athletes raced 26.2 miles (42.2 kilometers)
          to Copley Square in Boston for the world's oldest and most prestigious
          annual marathon. The 2020 race was called off because of the pandemic,
          the first cancellation since the event began in 1897. And the 2021
          version was postponed, then held in October. That was the first fall
          edition of the marathon. 
          <br /><br />The field was smaller for social distancing and
          the crowds were smaller too, though no less enthusiastic. More than
          28,000 runners were signed up to run Monday on the Patriots' Day
          holiday. It's the marathon's traditional spot on the calendar, on the
          day that commemorates the start of the Revolutionary War. About
          one-third of the National Guard group marched in October, too. Capt. Gus
          Ashton, 29, said the crowds last year were great and he's excited to get
          back out again and see even more people on the course.
